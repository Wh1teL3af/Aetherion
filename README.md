name: Aetherion
description: >
  Aetherion is a cutting-edge Hyper Denial of Service (HDoS) tool developed in Python, designed for high-intensity network stress testing. This tool simulates large-scale denial of service attacks to assess the robustness of network infrastructures and services. It is intended for use by security researchers, penetration testers, and network administrators to evaluate and stress-test networks ethically.
features:
  - TCP Flood Attack: Floods the target’s TCP connections with a high volume of valid HTTP requests. Utilizes up to 2000 concurrent threads to maximize impact and test resilience.
  - UDP Flood Attack: Sends a large volume of UDP packets to the target, causing potential network congestion and service interruptions.
  - ICMP Flood Attack: Sends a flood of ICMP packets to the target, impacting network layer services and causing potential outages.
advanced_capabilities:
  - High-Concurrency Execution: Supports up to 2000 concurrent threads per attack vector for comprehensive stress testing.
  - Safety and Monitoring: Includes safety warnings for system overload risks and monitors request counts to manage attack intensity.
usage_guidelines:
  - Ethical and Authorized Use Only: Aetherion is intended for educational purposes, authorized stress testing, and security research. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit permission before conducting any tests.
  - System Overload Warning: Due to high concurrency, Aetherion may strain systems, especially local machines. Ensure your testing environment can handle the load.
